GraphQL/Apollo
==============

Persisted Queries
-----------------

GraphQL querires, mutations and subscriptions are defined in `src/graphql` as `.graphql` files.
They can be used as persisted queries.

You can enable persisted queries by modifying `config.json`.

```json
{
    "persistedQueries": true
}
```

You need to generate `extracted_queries.json` by executing this.

```
% npm run persistgraphql
```

Read the following article to know about persisted queries.

Subscriptions
-------------

This example project uses subscriptions.
Select "GraphQL Subscription" tab in the header to see it.

It has not been integrated with authentication.
