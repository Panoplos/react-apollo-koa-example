react-apollo-koa-example
========================

An example web app using React, Apollo (GraphQL) and Koa v.2.

This project was generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
and is not [eject](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject)ed
some settings are overwritten on runtime though.

Setup
=====

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Install required packages.

```sh
% yarn
```

Copy `.env.default` to `.env` and edit it to change server-side settings.

Copy `config-default.json` to `config.json` and edit it to change client-side
settings.

The API server and the development web server launch on port 7000 and 3000
respectively. The development web server redirects API requests to
`localhost:7000`. The proxy setting is written in `package.json`.

Usage
=====

Launch the API server:

```sh
% yarn run server
```

Launch the development web server which serves the static client-side files:

```sh
% yarn start
```

Open the URL (default: `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser.

GraphQL/Apollo
==============

Persisted Queries
-----------------

GraphQL querires, mutations and subscriptions are defined in `src/graphql` as `.graphql` files.
They can be used as persisted queries.

You can enable persisted queries by modifying `config.json`.

```json
{
    "persistedQueries": true
}
```

You need to generate `extracted_queries.json` by executing this.

```sh
% yarn run persistgraphql
```

Read the following article to know about persisted queries.

* [Persisted GraphQL Queries with Apollo Client](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/persisted-graphql-queries-with-apollo-client-119fd7e6bba5#.wnzn2qlpf)

Subscriptions
-------------

This example project uses subscriptions.
Select "GraphQL Subscription" tab in the header to see it.

It has not been integrated with authentication.

Read the following article to know about subscriptions.

* [A proposal for GraphQL subscriptions](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/a-proposal-for-graphql-subscriptions-1d89b1934c18#.vso7t15e5)

Storybook
---------

This project uses [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook).
to develop and check presentational components.

Launch the Storybook server:

```sh
% yarn run storybook
```

[StoryShots](https://github.com/storybooks/storyshots) is also used to enable
snapshot tests.
When you modify a component and the render result is changed, Jest reports an
error. If the shown result is intended, press `u` to update the snapshot file.

Code Organization
-----------------

Redux actions, reducers and logic are managed by
[Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) rules in `src/ducks`
directory.

Tests are stored in `__tests__` directories under each component.

Git Hooks
---------

Git hooks are managed by [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
When you run `yarn` in this repo, Git hooks will be automatically created.

If you have a problem, you can create them manually.

```sh
% node_modules/husky/bin/install.js
```

Our Git hooks are defined in `package.json`.
